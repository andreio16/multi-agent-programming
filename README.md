## Netlogo Bussines Inversor ABM

We demonstrate the information acquisition design concept via a simple business model, in fields dealing with investors and organizations. This model simulates how people decide which business to invest in, when the alternative businesses they choose from differ in their annual profit and in their risk of failing such that the investors lose all their wealth.
